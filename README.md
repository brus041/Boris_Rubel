Data Scientist with problem solving abilities geared towards exploring Machine Learning, Data Science, and Computer Vision. A recent project, "Image Proccessing Website", is a gallery of my pursued interests which is an ongoing attempt to learn and bridge my passions for matrices with data science fundamentals.  

If not seen coding, I am probably up to:

- Optimizing and programming strength training routines
- Competing in Triathlon ( national age group qualifier in 2021 )
- Reading anything from Stephen King to autobiographies to topological theory
